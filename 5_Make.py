'''
A pedometer treats walking 2,000 steps as walking 1 mile. 

Write a steps_to_miles() function that takes the number of steps as a parameter and returns the miles walked. 

The steps_to_miles() function raises a ValueError object with the message "Exception: Negative step count entered." when the number of steps is negative.
 Complete the main() program that reads the number of steps from a user, calls the steps_to_miles() function, and outputs the returned value from the 
 steps_to_miles() function. Use a try-except block to catch any ValueError object raised by the steps_to_miles() function and output the exception message.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.2f}')

Ex: If the input of the program is:

5345
the output of the program is:

2.67
Ex: If the input of the program is:

-3850
the output of the program is:

Exception: Negative step count entered.
